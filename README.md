## Technologies Used

- **React:** _React.js is used to create modular components for a dynamic and responsive user interface, including App, MainPage, and PlayBar._

- **JavaScript:** _JavaScript is extensively used for handling user interactions, managing state, and implementing various features. Functions, such as audio playback control, search functionality, and time formatting, are implemented using JavaScript. The use of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features enhances code readability and conciseness in the project._

- **Material UI:** _Material UI is used to style and design UI components. Components such as IconButton and Slider from Material UI contribute to a cohesive and visually appealing design, enhancing the overall aesthetics of the application._

- **SCSS:** _SCSS is used to style components, providing a more maintainable and organized approach. Project styles are written in SCSS syntax and then compiled into regular CSS, allowing for cleaner and modular styling._
